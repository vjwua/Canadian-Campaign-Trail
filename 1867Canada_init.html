I would be grateful for any feedback. I chose 1867 as a logical beginning, a milestone from which to begin, including the political history of modern Canada. This is a continuation of my long-standing project called <b>The Way to the Confederation</b>, which describes the election of the 1860s. I have invested a great deal of effort in creating a narrative from disparate sources across multiple mediums: books, articles, newspapers, and websites. Welcome!</p><img src='https://www.ubcpress.ca/assets/76fa0674/9780774871402fc-371957-600x800.jpg' height='140px'><p>In the course of my work, I learned that <b>Ballots and Brawls</b> is scheduled to be released in early 2025. In the meantime, you can check out the other <b>Turning Point Elections</b> books. Also among my recommendations would be Pendulum of Power, which provides the accounts of campaign prior to 1968, and very comprehensive two-part Creighton's biography of John A. Macdonald.

The new parliamentary history will begin with a secure Coalition majority.</p><p>You look dominant, but it's going to be a difficult years to govern. The Confederation is not yet complete, and you need to find the key to disloyal Nova Scotians and to persuade Newfoundland and PEI to join. Prospects for the Western expansion are attractive, although surprises are not excluded. Be prepared to defend Canada's position when the Americans demand that Britain compensate for the damage.

Brown took to the campaign trail like a man reborn, winning one constituency after another for the Reformers. Other provinces followed suit. Reforms won over patriotism.</p><p>You're sitting in the opposition leader's bench you've been in before. You see Canada moving in a different direction. More change, more autonomy and responsibility. You hope that Brown, who has promised to be prime minister for no more than a term, will stumble on the restoration of Reciprocity or the inability to maintain ethnic equilibrium. To make matters worse, you were left penniless after the collapse of the Commercial Bank in Kingston.

Finally, it is time to enter the Parliament.</p><p>You are entering rough waters. For lack of a stable majority, you need to rely on individual members. You can call them by many different ways: loose fish, shaky fellows, waiters on providence. Patronage and infrastructure spendings will be an essential part of your activity.
